# Powershell setup 


Tools i use:

- [NerdFont](https://www.nerdfonts.com) : for fonts and icons

- [Oh my posh] (https://ohmyposh.dev/) : a prompt theme engine shell for Powershell 

- [z] (https://github.com/jethrokuan/z):z tracks the directories you visit. With a combination of frequency and recency, it enables you to jump to the directory in mind.

- [PSReadline] (https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine):
    - Syntax coloring
    - Simple syntax error notification
    - A good multi-line experience (both editing and history)
